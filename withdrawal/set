        [[4mGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...[m]

[m[1mDESCRIPTION[m
    gcloud config set sets the specified property in your active configuration
    only. A property governs the behavior of a specific aspect of Google Cloud
    CLI such as the service account to use or the verbosity level of logs. To
    set the property across all configurations, use the [1m--installation[m flag.
    For more information regarding creating and using configurations, see
    [1mgcloud topic configurations[m.

    To view a list of properties currently in use, run [1mgcloud config list[m.

    To unset properties, use [1mgcloud config unset[m.

    Google Cloud CLI comes with a [1mdefault[m configuration. To create multiple
    configurations, use [1mgcloud config configurations create[m, and [1mgcloud config
    configurations activate[m to switch between them.

    Note: If you are using Cloud Shell, your gcloud command-line tool
    preferences are stored in a temporary [1mtmp[m folder, set for your current tab
    only, and do not persist across sessions. For details on how to make these
    configurations persist, refer to the Cloud Shell guide on setting gcloud
    command-line tool preferences:
    https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/configuring-cloud-shell#gcloud_command-line_tool_preferences.

[m[1mEXAMPLES[m
    To set the [1mproject[m property in the core section, run:

        $ gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID

    To set the [1mzone[m property in the [1mcompute[m section, run:

        $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE_NAME

    To disable prompting for scripting, run:

        $ gcloud config set disable_prompts true

    To set a proxy with the appropriate type, and specify the address and port
    on which to reach it, run:

        $ gcloud config set proxy/type http
        $ gcloud config set proxy/address 1.234.56.78
        $ gcloud config set proxy/port 8080

    For a full list of accepted values, see the Google Cloud CLI properties
    page: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/properties.

[m[1mPOSITIONAL ARGUMENTS[m
     [4mSECTION[m/[4mPROPERTY[m
        Property to be set. Note that SECTION/ is optional while referring to
        properties in the core section, i.e., using either [1mcore/project[m or
        [1mproject[m is a valid way of setting a project. Using section names is
        required for setting other properties like [1mcompute/region[m. Consult the
        Available Properties section below for a comprehensive list of
        properties.

     [4mVALUE[m
        Value to be set.

[m[1mFLAGS[m
     [1m--installation[m
        If set, the property is updated for the entire Google Cloud CLI
        installation. Otherwise, by default, the property is updated only in
        the currently active configuration.

[m[1mGCLOUD WIDE FLAGS[m
    These flags are available to all commands: --access-token-file, --account,
    --billing-project, --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format,
    --help, --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run [1m$ gcloud help[m for details.

[m[1mAVAILABLE PROPERTIES[m
     [4mcore[m
         [1maccount[m
            Account [1mgcloud[m should use for authentication. Run [1mgcloud auth list[m
            to see your currently available accounts.

         [1mconsole_log_format[m
            Control the format used to display log messages to the console.

            Valid values are:
            â–¸ [1mstandard[m - Simplified log messages are displayed on the
              console.
            â–¸ [1mdetailed[m - More detailed messages are displayed on the console.

            If unset, default is [1mstandard[m.

         [1mcustom_ca_certs_file[m
            Absolute path to a custom CA cert file.

         [1mdefault_regional_backend_service[m
            If True, backend services in [1mgcloud compute backend-services[m will
            be regional by default. Setting the [1m--global[m flag is required for
            global backend services.

         [1mdisable_color[m
            If True, color will not be used when printing messages in the
            terminal.

         [1mdisable_file_logging[m
            If True, [1mgcloud[m will not store logs to a file. This may be useful
            if disk space is limited.

         [1mdisable_prompts[m
            If True, the default answer will be assumed for all user prompts.
            However, for any prompts that require user input, an error will be
            raised. This is equivalent to either using the global [1m--quiet[m flag
            or setting the environment variable [1mCLOUDSDK_CORE_DISABLE_PROMPTS[m
            to 1. Setting this property is useful when scripting with [1mgcloud[m.

         [1mdisable_usage_reporting[m
            If True, anonymous statistics on SDK usage will not be collected.
            This value is set by default based on your choices during
            installation, but can be changed at any time. For more information,
            see: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/usage-statistics

         [1menable_feature_flags[m
            If True, remote config-file driven feature flags will be enabled.

         [1mlog_http[m
            If True, log HTTP requests and responses to the logs. To see logs
            in the terminal, adjust [1mverbosity[m settings. Otherwise, logs are
            available in their respective log files.

         [1mmax_log_days[m
            Maximum number of days to retain log files before deleting. If set
            to 0, turns off log garbage collection and does not delete log
            files. If unset, the default is 30 days.

         [1mpass_credentials_to_gsutil[m
            If True, pass the configured Google Cloud CLI authentication to
            gsutil.

         [1mproject[m
            Project ID of the Cloud Platform project to operate on by default.
            This can be overridden by using the global [1m--project[m flag.

         [1mshow_structured_logs[m
            Control when JSON-structured log messages for the current verbosity
            level (and above) will be written to standard error. If this
            property is disabled, logs are formatted as [1mtext[m by default.

            Valid values are:
            â–¸ [1mnever[m - Log messages as text
            â–¸ [1malways[m - Always log messages as JSON
            â–¸ [1mlog[m - Only log messages as JSON if stderr is a file
            â–¸ [1mterminal[m - Only log messages as JSON if stderr is a terminal

            If unset, default is [1mnever[m.

         [1mtrace_token[m
            Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
            issues. This token will be provided by Google support.

         [1muser_output_enabled[m
            True, by default. If False, messages to the user and command output
            on both standard output and standard error will be suppressed.

         [1mverbosity[m
            Default logging verbosity for [1mgcloud[m commands. This is the
            equivalent of using the global [1m--verbosity[m flag. Supported
            verbosity levels: [1mdebug[m, [1minfo[m, [1mwarning[m, [1merror[m, [1mcritical[m, and [1mnone[m.

     [4maccessibility[m
         [1mscreen_reader[m
            Make gcloud more screen reader friendly.

     [4mai[m
         [1mregion[m
            Default region to use when working with AI Platform resources. When
            a [1m--region[m flag is required but not provided, the command will fall
            back to this value, if set.

     [4mai_platform[m
         [1mregion[m
            Default region to use when working with AI Platform Training and
            Prediction resources (currently for Prediction only). It is ignored
            for training resources for now. The value should be either [1mglobal[m
            or one of the supported regions. When a [1m--region[m flag is required
            but not provided, the command will fall back to this value, if set.

         [1mpromote_by_default[m
            If True, when deploying a new version of a service, that version
            will be promoted to receive all traffic for the service. This
            property can be overridden with the [1m--promote-by-default[m or

         [1mlocation[m
            Default location to use when working with Artifact Registry
            resources. When a [1mlocation[m value is required but not provided, the
            command will fall back to this value, if set. If this value is

            optional.

         [1mrepository[m
            Default repository to use when working with Artifact Registry
            resources. When a [1mrepository[m value is required but not provided,
            the command will fall back to this value, if set.

     [4mauth[m
         [1maccess_token_file[m
            A file path to read the access token. Use this property to
            authenticate gcloud with an access token. The credentials of the
            active account (if it exists) will be ignored. The file should
            contain an access token with no other information.

         [1mdisable_credentials[m
            If True, [1mgcloud[m will not attempt to load any credentials or
            authenticate any requests. This is useful when behind a proxy that
            adds authentication to requests.

         [1mimpersonate_service_account[m
            While set, all API requests will be made as the given service
            account or target service account in an impersonation delegation
            chain instead of the currently selected account. You can specify
            either a single service account as the impersonator, or a
            comma-separated list of service accounts to create an impersonation
            delegation chain. This is done without needing to create, download,
            or activate a key for the service account or accounts.

            In order to make API requests as a service account, your currently
            selected account must have an IAM role that includes the
            [1miam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken[m permission for the service
            account or accounts.

            The [1mroles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator[m role has the
            [1miam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission[m. You can also create
            a custom role.

            You can specify a list of service accounts, separated with commas.
            This creates an impersonation delegation chain in which each
            service account delegates its permissions to the next service
            account in the chain. Each service account in the list must have
            the [1mroles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator[m role on the next service
            account in the list. For example, when the property is set through
            [1mgcloud config set auth/impersonate_service_account=[m
            [1m[1;4mSERVICE_ACCOUNT_1[1m[m,[1m[1;4mSERVICE_ACCOUNT_2[1m[m, the active account must have
            the [1mroles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator[m role on [1m[1;4mSERVICE_ACCOUNT_1[1m[m,
            which must have the [1mroles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator[m role on
            [1m[1;4mSERVICE_ACCOUNT_2[1m[m. [1m[1;4mSERVICE_ACCOUNT_1[1m[m is the impersonated service
            account and [1m[1;4mSERVICE_ACCOUNT_2[1m[m is the delegate.

         [1mtoken_host[m
            Overrides the token endpoint to provision access tokens. It can be
            used with Private Service Connect.

            operations performed in [1mgcloud[m. When unset, the default is
            [CURRENT_PROJECT]. This default bills and charges quota against the
            current project. If you need to operate on one project, but need to
            bill your usage against or use quota from a different project, you
            can use this flag to specify the billing project. If both
            [1mbilling/quota_project[m and [1m--billing-project[m are specified,
            [1m--billing-project[m takes precedence.

     [4mbuilds[m
         [1mkaniko_cache_ttl[m

            caching is disabled.

         [1mregion[m
            Default region to use when working with Cloud Build resources. When
            a [1m--region[m flag is required but not provided, the command will fall
            back to this value, if set.

         [1mtimeout[m
            Timeout, in seconds, to wait for builds to complete. If unset,
            defaults to 10 minutes.

         [1muse_kaniko[m

            IP of the desired instance, which may be wrong if the desired
            instance is in a different subnet but happens to share the same
            internal IP as an instance in the current subnet. Defaults to True.

     [4mstorage[m
         [1mbase_retry_delay[m
            Second delay between retrying operations. May be multiplied by
            exponential_sleep_multiplier.

         [1mcheck_hashes[m
            'check_hashes' specifies how strictly to require integrity checking
            for downloaded data. Legal values are:

            â–¸ 'if_fast_else_fail' - (default) Only integrity check if the
              digest will run efficiently (using compiled code), else fail the
              download.

            â–¸ 'if_fast_else_skip' - Only integrity check if the server
              supplies a hash and the local digest computation will run
              quickly, else skip the check.

            â–¸ 'always' - Always check download integrity regardless of
              possible performance costs.

            â–¸ 'never' - Don't perform download integrity checks. This setting
              is not recommended except for special cases such as measuring
              download performance excluding time for integrity checking.

            This option exists to assist users who wish to download a composite
            object and are unable to install crcmod with the C-extension.
            CRC32c is the only available integrity check for composite objects,
            and without the C-extension, download performance can be
            significantly degraded by the digest computation. This option is
            ignored for daisy-chain copies, which don't compute hashes but
            instead (inexpensively) compare the cloud source and destination
            hashes.

         [1mconvert_incompatible_windows_path_characters[m
            Allows automatic conversion of invalid path characters on Windows.
            If not enabled, Windows will raise an OSError if an invalid
            character is encountered.

         [1mcopy_chunk_size[m
            Chunk size used for copying to in clouds or on disk.

         [1mdownload_chunk_size[m
            Chunk size used for downloadinging to clouds.

         [1mexponential_sleep_multiplier[m
            Used in exponential backoff for retrying operations.

         [1mmax_retries[m
            Max number of retries for operations like copy.

         [1mmax_retry_delay[m
            Max second delay between retriable operations.

         [1mparallel_composite_upload_component_size[m
            Specifies the ideal size of a component in bytes, which will act as
            an upper bound to the size of the components if ceil(file_size /
            parallel_composite_upload_component_size) is less than the maximum
            number of objects the API allows composing at once. Values can be
            provided either in bytes or as human-readable values (e.g., "150M"
            to represent 150 mebibytes).

         [1mparallel_composite_upload_threshold[m
            Specifies the maximum size of a file to upload in a single stream.
            Files larger than this threshold will be partitioned into component
            parts, uploaded in parallel, then composed into a single object.
            The number of components will be the smaller of ceil(file_size /
            parallel_composite_upload_component_size) and the maximum number of
            objects the API allows composing at once. For Cloud Storage this
            limit is 32. If this property is set to 0, then automatic parallel
            uploads will never occur.

         [1mprocess_count[m
            The maximum number of processes parallel execution should use. When
            process_count and thread_count are both 1, commands use sequential
            execution.

         [1mresumable_threshold[m
            File operations above this size in bytes will use resumable instead
            of one-shot strategies. For example, a resumable download.

         [1ms3_endpoint_url[m
            If set, boto3 client will connect to this endpoint. Otherwise,
            boto3 selects a default endpoint based on the AWS service used.

         [1msliced_object_download_component_size[m
            Target size and upper bound for files to be sliced into. Analogous
            to parallel_composite_upload_component_size.

         [1msliced_object_download_max_components[m
            Specifies the maximum number of slices to be used when performing a
            sliced object download. Set None for no limit.

         [1msliced_object_download_threshold[m
            Slice files larger than this value. Zero will block sliced
            downloads. Analogous to parallel_composite_upload_threshold.

         [1mthread_count[m
            The number of threads parallel execution should use per process.
            When process_count and thread_count are both 1, commands use
            sequential execution.

         [1mtracker_files_directory[m
            Directory path to tracker files for resumable operations.

         [1mupload_chunk_size[m
            Chunk size used for uploading to clouds.

         [1muse_gsutil[m
            If True, use the deprecated upload implementation which uses
            gsutil.

         [1muse_magicfile[m
            If True, uses the [1mfile --mime <filename>[m command to guess content
            types instead of the default filename extension-based mechanism.
            Available on UNIX and macOS (and possibly on Windows, if you're
            running Cygwin or some other package that provides implementations
            of UNIX-like commands). When available and enabled use_magicfile
            should be more robust because it analyzes file contents in addition
            to extensions.

         [1muse_threading_local[m
            If True, reuses some resource if they are already declared on a
            thread. If False, creates duplicates of resources like API clients
            on the same thread. Turning off can help with some bugs but will
            hurt performance.

     [4msurvey[m
         [1mdisable_prompts[m
            If True, gcloud will not prompt you to take periodic usage
            experience surveys.

     [4mvmware[m
         [1mregion[m
            Default region to use when working with VMware Engine resources.
            When a [1m--region[m flag is required but not provided, the command will
            fall back to this value, if set.
